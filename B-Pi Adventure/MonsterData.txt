Keynote/September/You see a path that leads to a clearing, filled with flowers, 
and a path that leads deeper into the woods. You hear the rush 
of a waterfall from the one that leads deeper into the woods. 
Do you take the path into the woods(1) or head towards the waterfall(2)?
/You see a wooden bridge ahead and you cross  it. 
The birds are chirping and there is a light breeze in the air… 
the weather is perfect and you almost want to take a picture of the moment. 
You walk on contently. The bridge snaps, and you grab onto a rope. Your life 
is spared but not without damage-- you have sprained your wrist, and you know 
the rest of the journey will be very difficult because of this injury.
/You see a rock in front of you, with a giant handle of something embedded in. 
On the rock is a note which says “The pen may be mightier than the sword.. 
but a key opens any door.” Do you pull the handle(1) or walk on(2)?
/You walk past the suspicious rock and continue on your journey. As you walk past, 
the rock disappears, and you’re glad you avoided that trap. You’re safe.. For now.
/You pull the handle, and you find out that it is a large key. The key flies out of 
your hand and transforms into a large sword, and the note transforms into a giant 
knight made out of paper./fight/a/b/c/d/a/Keynote/September/You see a path that leads to a clearing, filled with flowers,
